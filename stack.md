React.createElement - method to invoke the constructor and create a new instance of a component.

ReactComponent = class - is a constructor function that, once invoked, is expected to return a Javascript object with at least a render method on it.

ReactElement - encapsulates style, behavior, and markup into one package and reuse the component.

createClass = to create a component

createElement = to create an instance of that class, resulting in an element that can be used in other components

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";

 * Yarn - replaces the usage of the npm CLI client 
```shell
yarn add react
```
```shell
npm install --global yarn
```

#

Yarn is 100% deterministic.  npm's installs are nondeterministic (install in different wyas from different states)..

#### *yarn installs*
Run `yarn` from the directory where you downloaded the repo.

#### *yarn global installs*
```shell
yarn global add jest@v16.0.2
yarn global add nodemon
yarn global add webpack@v2.1.0-beta.25
yarn global add standard@v8.4.0
```
### tooling
#### *standard*
standard is a linting tool.  `yarn global add standard` is a wrapper around a pre-configured **eslint**
linting tools programatically checks for certain violations of code style in your code
it makes sure there are no unused variables and there is use of undeclared variabels in code
